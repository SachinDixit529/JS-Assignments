    <h2>Question 2 : Write the difference between var, let and const with code examples.</h2>
</head>
<body>
    In Javascript one can define variables using the keywords var, let or const.
    var a=10;
    let b=20;
    const PI=3.14;
    The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “var” is global.
    The scope of a variable defined with the keyword “let” or “const” is limited to the “block” defined by curly braces i.e. {} .
    <script>
        var a=10;
        console.log(a);
        {
 let a=10;
 console.log(a);
} //block 1
{
  a++;
  console.log(a);
} //block 2
const PI=3.14;
 console.log(PI);
 const a = [1,2,3];
 const b = {name: "hello"};
 a.push(4,5);     //mutating the value of constant "a"
 b.name="World";  //mutating the value of constant "b"
 
 console.log(a); //this will show [1,2,3,4,5]
 console.log(b); //this will show {name: "World"}
 {
 const name = "Mike";
 const PI = 3.14; 
 const a = [1,2,3];
 const b = {name: "hello"};
 
 name="Joe"; 
//this will throw an error, since we are attempting to re-assign "name" to a different value.
 PI = PI + 1; 
//this will throw an error, since we are attempting to re-assign PI to a different value.
 a = [1,2,3,4,5];
//this will throw an error, since we are attempting to re-assign "a" to a different value.
 b = {name: "hello"};
//this will throw an error, since we are attempting to re-assign "b" to a different value.
}
    </script>
